* scale factor for all indexes reduces after 8 threads
* dash has the highest throughput in all workloads.
* In terms of P50 and P99 latencies, dash > lbtree > bztree.
* bztree has unusually high tail (P99) latencies. Maybe it is not optimized for data locality. L3 misses are 5x-6x more than dash/lbtree.
BZTREE:-
* Leaf Nodes should only have free space for insertions, to save space we shouldn't waste such space in internal nodes. Internal nodes support full copy replacement.
* bwTree's indirection logic makes performance degrade

Design points:
* 256 byte nodes/buckets
* fingerprinting
* concurrency - pmwcas vs optimistic locking vs HTM in lbtree
* failure recovery
